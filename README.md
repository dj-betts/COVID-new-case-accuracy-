## Primary Proposal

**Question:** *Do the "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 for Texas counties indicate the "true infection cases" for that area estimated by the historical deaths in that county?*

The idea is inspired by this [Khan Academy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCa0JXEwDEk&t=661s) that was released at the very beginning of the american outbreak, and his video is based off Tomas Pueyo's  [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) and [research](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/parameter_estimates/2019_novel_coronavirus). I've read the first of his series of three articles on COVID, but haven't had time to look through the github.

I think the question is simple enough to be answer based on Texas county data I've found that is attached. The experiment estimates the actual number of infected people based on eventual deaths in that area with a mortality rate of 1%. 

Future research may include recalibrating the estimated deaths based on a changing mortality rate, which is a myriad of varying factors including hospital capacity, and R(avg number of people infected by one infection), or the how ["super spreader"](https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html) events impacted the R of specific outbreaks. Future development includes epidemic simpulaions([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs), [github](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/shaders/from_3b1b/old/sir.py)).

## Alternate Proposal

**Question:** *Compared to past seasons of ALLEGED cheating, has the Astros hitting decreased this past season by a statistically significant amount?*

*Was there a statistical difference between home and away game hitting percentages?*

[Houston Astros' Statistics](https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/stats/_/name/hou) for the past 18 seasons including posteasons if applicable.
