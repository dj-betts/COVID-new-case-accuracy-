## Primary Proposal

**Question:** *Do the "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 for Texas counties indicate the "true infection cases" for that area estimated by the historical deaths in that county?*

The idea is inspired by this [Khan Academy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCa0JXEwDEk&t=661s) that was released at the very beginning of the American outbreak in mid-March. Khan's video is based off Tomas Pueyo's  [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) and [research](https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19/tree/master/parameter_estimates/2019_novel_coronavirus).

Experiemnt will be done with regularly updated [case](https://github.com/dj-betts/COVID-new-case-accuracy-/blob/main/Texas%20COVID-19%20Case%20Count%20Data%20by%20County.csv) and [fatality](https://github.com/dj-betts/COVID-new-case-accuracy-/blob/main/Texas%20COVID-19%20Fatality%20Count%20Data%20by%20County.csv) rates in Texas by county. Initial experiments will estimate a [mortailty rate](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality) of 1% and range of [R](https://rt.live/) between 1.2 and 1.4.

Future research may include recalibrating the estimated deaths based on a changing mortality rate, which is a myriad of varying factors including hospital capacity of a given county, and R(avg number of people infected by one infection), or the how ["super spreader"](https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html) events impacted the R of specific outbreaks. Future development includes epidemic simpulaions([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs), [github](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/shaders/from_3b1b/old/sir.py)).

## Alternate Proposal

**Question:** *Compared to past seasons of ALLEGED cheating, has the Astros hitting decreased this past season by a statistically significant amount?*

*Was there a statistical difference between home and away game hitting percentages?*

[Houston Astros' Statistics](https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/stats/_/name/hou) for the past 18 seasons including posteasons if applicable.
